# 🚀 KYC Status Fix - Deployment Guide

## Problem Fixed
✅ Bot now shows real KYC status from StroWallet instead of "Registration Status: Incomplete"

## How to Deploy to Your Production Server (cPanel)

### Step 1: Download the Fixed File
1. In this Replit project, navigate to: `public_html/bot/webhook.php`
2. Download the file to your computer

### Step 2: Upload to cPanel
1. Log in to your cPanel account
2. Open **File Manager**
3. Navigate to: `public_html/bot/`
4. Upload and replace the existing `webhook.php` file

### Step 3: Test Immediately
1. Open your Telegram bot
2. Send: `/status`
3. You should now see:
   - ✅ "KYC Verification Status: ⏳ Under Review" (instead of "Incomplete")
   - Real-time status from StroWallet

## What Happens After Deployment

🔐 KYC Verification Status:

⏳ Status: Under Review

Your documents are being reviewed by our compliance team.
⏱️ Typical verification time: 24-48 hours
📱 You'll receive a notification once your verification is complete.
💡 Tip: Use /status anytime to check your current status.
```

## Technical Details

### What the Fix Does:
1. **Fetches Real Status**: When user sends `/status`, bot calls StroWallet API to get actual KYC status
2. **Auto-Syncs Database**: Updates local database with StroWallet customer ID and KYC status
3. **Smart Mapping**: Maps StroWallet statuses correctly:
   - "Unreview KYC" / "under_review" → "Under Review" ⏳
   - "verified" / "approved" → "Verified" ✅
   - "rejected" / "failed" → "Rejected" ❌

### Code Changes Summary:
- Modified: `handleCheckStatus()` function in `webhook.php`
- Added: Real-time API call to `/bitvcard/getcardholder/` endpoint
- Added: Automatic database sync with StroWallet data
- Improved: Logic to only show "Incomplete" for truly unregistered users

## Verification

### Check Logs on cPanel (Optional)
After deployment, check your error logs to see the fix in action:
```
Fetching customer status from StroWallet for user 8373566564...
Fetched KYC status from StroWallet: Unreview KYC (mapped to: pending)
Updated user 8373566564: strowallet_customer_id=XXX, kyc_status=pending
```

## Need Help?
If you encounter any issues after deployment, check:
1. File permissions (should be 644)
2. Database connection is working
3. StroWallet API keys are configured in your environment
