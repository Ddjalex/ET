# Registration Bug Fixes - October 22, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Phone Number Missing in API Call ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- User entered phone number (e.g., "0974408281") appeared in the review screen
- When user confirmed registration, API call failed with "Missing required field: phone_number"
- Registration could not complete

**Root Cause:**
- Database schema uses column name `phone` (corrected in recent migration)
- But the API validation and data preparation still referenced old column name `phone_number`
- Similar issues with `email`, `address_city`, `address_state`, `address_zip` vs old names

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `createStroWalletCustomerFromDB()` function in `webhook.php`:
  - Changed validation array from `phone_number` ‚Üí `phone`
  - Changed validation array from `customer_email` ‚Üí `email`
  - Changed validation array from `city` ‚Üí `address_city`
  - Changed validation array from `state` ‚Üí `address_state`
  - Changed validation array from `zip_code` ‚Üí `address_zip`
  - Updated API data preparation to use correct column names
  - Added backward compatibility for photo URL fields

**Files Modified:**
- `public_html/bot/webhook.php` (lines 1299-1340)

### 2. ID Type Selection Using Text Names Instead of Numbers ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Bot prompted users to select ID type by typing text names like "GOVERNMENT_ID", "PASSPORT"
- Users typing "GOVERNMENT_ID" worked but was not user-friendly
- Bot did not confirm which ID type was selected after user input
- As shown in user's screenshot #3, when user entered text name, bot didn't respond with the ID type

**Root Cause:**
- Registration flow showed text options instead of numbered choices
- No conversion from user-friendly number selection to ID type names
- No confirmation message showing selected ID type

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated ID type selection to use numbered options (1, 2, 3):
  - Country ET: 1Ô∏è‚É£ National ID, 2Ô∏è‚É£ Government ID, 3Ô∏è‚É£ Passport
  - Country NG: 1Ô∏è‚É£ BVN, 2Ô∏è‚É£ NIN, 3Ô∏è‚É£ Passport
  - Other: 1Ô∏è‚É£ National ID, 2Ô∏è‚É£ Driver License, 3Ô∏è‚É£ Passport
- Added number-to-ID-type mapping based on user's country
- Added validation to ensure user enters 1, 2, or 3
- Added confirmation message showing selected ID type in readable format
  - Example: User types "2" ‚Üí Bot responds "‚úÖ Got it! You selected: **Government Id**"

**Files Modified:**
- `public_html/bot/webhook.php`:
  - Lines 983-994: Updated prompt to show numbered options
  - Lines 996-1048: Added number mapping logic and confirmation message
  - Lines 1408-1422: Updated continue/prompt function
