## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **KYC Customer Details Error** ✅
**Problem:** When clicking "View" button, got error: `Failed to fetch customer details - Unexpected token '<'`

**Root Cause:** Session/auth wasn't loaded before AJAX endpoints, causing PHP to output login redirect HTML instead of JSON

**Solution:**
- Moved session and database loading to the TOP of `kyc.php`
- Moved header include to AFTER all AJAX processing
- Now AJAX endpoints return proper JSON

**Files Modified:**
- `public_html/admin/kyc.php` - Restructured to load session first

**Result:** ✅ Customer details now load correctly from StroWallet API!

---

### 2. **Broadcaster File Upload** ✅
**Problem:** Could only enter URLs for photos/videos, wanted to upload files directly

**Solution:** Added complete file upload functionality!

**Features Added:**
- ✅ File upload input field (replaces URL input)
- ✅ Support for images: JPG, PNG, GIF (max 10MB)
- ✅ Support for videos: MP4, MOV (max 50MB)
- ✅ Files stored in `/uploads/broadcasts/` directory
- ✅ Automatic file validation and security
- ✅ Shows current uploaded file when editing
- ✅ Keeps existing file if no new file uploaded

**Files Modified:**
- `public_html/admin/broadcast-create.php`:
  - Added file upload handling logic
  - Added `enctype="multipart/form-data"` to form
  - Changed media URL field to file upload field
  - Updated JavaScript to show upload field

**Result:** ✅ Can now upload photos and videos directly!

## 📁 Technical Changes Made

### KYC Page Fix (`public_html/admin/kyc.php`)

**Before:**
```php
<?php
$pageTitle = 'User Management';
require_once __DIR__ . '/includes/header.php'; // ❌ Header loaded first
require_once __DIR__ . '/config/database.php';
```

**After:**
```php
<?php
// Load session and database BEFORE any HTML output or AJAX endpoints
require_once __DIR__ . '/config/session.php'; // ✅ Session first
require_once __DIR__ . '/config/database.php';
requireAdminLogin();
$currentAdmin = getCurrentAdmin();

// ... AJAX endpoints here ...

// Now include header AFTER all processing
require_once __DIR__ . '/includes/header.php'; // ✅ Header after AJAX
```

### Broadcaster File Upload (`public_html/admin/broadcast-create.php`)

#### 1. Added Upload Directory
```bash
Created: public_html/uploads/broadcasts/
Permissions: 755 (writable)
```

#### 2. Added File Upload Handling
```php
// Handle file upload for photo/video
$mediaUrl = trim($_POST['existing_media_url'] ?? '');
if (isset($_FILES['media_file']) && $_FILES['media_file']['error'] === UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {
    $uploadDir = __DIR__ . '/../../uploads/broadcasts/';
    $allowedImageTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'];
    $allowedVideoTypes = ['video/mp4', 'video/quicktime', 'video/x-msvideo'];
    
    $fileType = $_FILES['media_file']['type'];
    $fileSize = $_FILES['media_file']['size'];
    $fileExt = strtolower(pathinfo($_FILES['media_file']['name'], PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
    
    // Validate file type
    $isValidImage = in_array($fileType, $allowedImageTypes) && $fileSize <= 10 * 1024 * 1024;
    $isValidVideo = in_array($fileType, $allowedVideoTypes) && $fileSize <= 50 * 1024 * 1024;
    
    if ($isValidImage || $isValidVideo) {
        $fileName = uniqid('broadcast_' . time() . '_') . '.' . $fileExt;
        $uploadPath = $uploadDir . $fileName;
        
        if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['media_file']['tmp_name'], $uploadPath)) {
            $mediaUrl = '/uploads/broadcasts/' . $fileName;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Updated Form
```html
<!-- Before: URL input -->
<input type="url" name="media_url" ... />

<!-- After: File upload input -->
<input type="file" name="media_file" accept="image/*,video/*" ... />
<small>Supported: JPG, PNG, GIF (max 10MB) | MP4, MOV (max 50MB)</small>
```

#### 4. Updated Form Tag
```html
<!-- Before -->
<form method="POST" id="broadcastForm">

<!-- After -->
<form method="POST" id="broadcastForm" enctype="multipart/form-data">
```
