exchange_rate, deposit_fee_etb, total_etb, payment_method,
screenshot_file_id, screenshot_url, transaction_number,

### `deposits` (Legacy System)
Old deposit tracking system - still visible in admin panel but not used by current bot flow.

## How to Test

### Option 1: Create Test Payment (Recommended for Quick Test)
Run this SQL query to create a test payment:

```sql
INSERT INTO deposit_payments (
    user_id, telegram_id, amount_usd, amount_etb, 
    exchange_rate, deposit_fee_etb, total_etb, 
    payment_method, transaction_number, status, 
    created_at, updated_at
) VALUES (
    1, 383870190, 25.00, 3125.00, 
    125.00, 500.00, 3625.00, 
    'telebirr', 'TEST-TXN-20251101-001', 'pending',
    NOW(), NOW()
);
```

Then:
1. Login to admin panel: `/admin/login.php` (admin / admin123)
2. Navigate to "Payment Verification"
3. See the test payment listed
4. Click "Approve Payment" or "Reject Payment"

### Option 2: Test via Telegram Bot
1. Configure Telegram webhook to point to your bot
2. Start conversation with bot
3. Use `/deposit_etb` command
4. Follow the complete flow
5. Check admin panel for submission
